# DISC Project Management

At the start of Winter Quarter, I was handed an unexpected bone. While I applied to Develop and Innovate for Social Change as a Software Engineer, the email was clear: I had two days to accept the role of Project Manager for a local non-profit - the Clark Street Beach Bird Sanctuary (CSBBS). Naturally, I accepted.

### The Challenge

I've been a project manager before, but only in small group settings with low stakes: group projects. This was entirely a new beast - talking to clients while simulatenously managing a team of backend and frontend software engineers, UI/UX designers. I didn't have a clue.

At the time, I was taking `DSGN 395 - Design Research - Learning to See People and Their Patterns`. Naturally, I asked Professor Aye about the design/project management aspect of the class. The main piece of feedback that he impacted upon me was being able to really emphasize with our clients, and the best way to do that was inside of the environment that they were most used to. In this context, it was the bird sanctuary - just a five minute walk from my dorm.

I forced my team to go with me, although I was just as unsure what would happen as them. But, we had the most amazing experience being able to walk around the sanctuary and have a conversation with Libby Hill, one of the sanctuary's founders. It gave us a ton of insight into what we should do, but more importantly, _why_.

Today, this challenge is coming to a close. We're presenting our final product to the clients in the DISC showcase in about three hours, and I can see how great of an experience it was for everyone and myself. I've learned a ton, and I'm excited to see what the future holds.
